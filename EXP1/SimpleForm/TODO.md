# TODO for Simple Form SPA

- [x] Modify App.jsx to replace existing content with a form component
- [x] Add form fields: name (text input) and email (email input)
- [x] Use React useState to manage form input values and submitted data
- [x] Implement form submission: on submit, store input data in state and display it below the form
- [x] Run development server to test form functionality
